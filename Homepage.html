<h1 class="rainbow">This is just a homepage, so I dont know what to put here. I'll give the story about how I created Larry the Orca. On the very first project of the year, a simple one-page website showing the highlights
of my summer. I finished it pretty early because I'm a genius, so I was just messing around on the interwebs. I eventually came across a website showing an orca. However, this was not just any orca.
This was an orca that followed your cursor! I was playing around with him, and decided that I wanted him on my website. I named him Larry the Orca, and it took me a few weeks to finally get
him on my website. I tried many different things, such as saving it as a gif, saving it as a flash, saving it as an image, but NOTHING WORKED. Finally, after, like, 3 weeks, I got him on my local website. 
Then I uploaded everything to Github and finalized my website. Everything was perfect....but LARRY WASN'T THERE. LIKE WTF IT TOOK ME 3 WEEKS. OMG. Anyway, I continued working for 2 more weeks and after countless hours, I FINALLY 
got him onto the finalized public website. Ever since then, he's been kind of a mascot, logo, a personal stamp for me. He's in every one of my projects.
So you should go check him out. BTW if he doesn't appear on this website, PLEASE TELL ME. Have fun. Oh, by the way, if the awesomeness of this text color is too much for your normal eyes to handle, you can always 
click the button at the top to switch it to some non-awesome color.</h1>
